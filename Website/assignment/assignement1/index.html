                The author of the article is delusional about online communities being destroyed for malicious reasons.
                She is suggesting that the platforms were suppressed when in reality, the platforms experienced natural
                user changes over time. Instead of acknowledging that social media landscapes shift due to evolving
                trends and audience preferences, she tries to create a conspiracy. " But the long and short of it is:
                Russia killed Livejournal. The Russian government, using corporate entities.” This statement wrongly
                suggests that an external force killed LiveJournal when, in reality, users simply moved on to other
                platforms that better suited their needs like facebook and twitter. The internet is always changing and
                no platform is entitled to relevance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another exaggerated claim she makes is that online communities are being weaponized against each other,
                as if users are being forced into conflict rather than simply engaging in discussions. “These were our
                spaces, little people who just wanted to connect. And one by one, they get turned into battlefields
                where we have to fight just as hard to exist as we do in the real world”. This statement exaggerates the
                natural progression of online spaces. The internet has never been free of conflict, and platforms evolve
                based on how the world interacts with them. Instead of complaining about the presence of trolls or
                misinformation, we should take responsibility for curating our experiences and adapting to the
                environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                The author also <strong>CONTRADICTS</strong> herself by admitting that content comes from users rather than the platform
                itself, yet she still blames corporations for communities fading away. “People dont really want what
                little a site thats now solely supported by the free content created by the community has to offer.
                They want the community.” If the value of a platform is in the people rather than the framework, then
                why does it matter if a platform declines? People can move on to new digital spaces, which is exactly
                what has happened repeatedly throughout internet history. The idea that these communities were taken
                away ignores the reality that users actively choose to migrate elsewhere.
            </p>   
            <p>
                The authors argument about Elon Musk and Twitter is another example of misplaced blame. She portrays
                Musk as singlehandedly responsible for the platforms decline, failing to recognize that businesses
                naturally change direction based on market forces. “One unimaginably rich man should not be able to take
                away the livelihoods of millions of people just paying the fucking rent.” This is a stupid take that
                ignores the fact that no single person can destroy an entire digital economy. Companies are profit
                driven and social media platforms will always prioritize sustainability. If artists and creators relied
                solely on Twitter for income, that was always a risky decision, as no platform has historically lasted
                forever.
            </p>   
            <p>
                She also acts as though platforms must be the sole enforcers of moderation rather than empowering users
                to share their own experiences. “Use good moderation to make non-monster humans feel safe expressing
                themselves and feel nice about site so they use it more.” Platforms already offer tools to mute, block,
                and filter content. Instead of expecting a social media site to micromanage every interaction, people
                should take advantage of these features. The authors frustration seems less about actual suppression and
                more about the unwillingness to take <strong>PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY</strong> for navigating online spaces.

                Despite the author being born in 1979 she does not seem to understand digital communities. The author
                also has unreBalistic expectations for others to conform to her standards of morality. The internet is
                always evolving and multiple times throughout the article she contradicts herself. The internet is not
                being stolen or erased it is simply EVOLVING.
